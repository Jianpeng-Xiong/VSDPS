A dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with variable stepsize and dual prediction strategies
======
üêìIntroduction
-------
Welcome to my GitHub homepage, where my papers and code are available. 
This is my second article on dynamic multi-objective optimization, mainly completed by my team member Pi.
My work involves supervision, polishing, and guidance. The first author is my supervisor, Hu Peng, the second is Chen Pi, and I am the third author.
Sharing and helping have also brought me tremendous progress.
If you have any questions about this article or related fields, please feel free to communicate with me at any time. QQ-emailüíå: 1972026766@qq.com. üòá

üê®Environment
---
The operating environment is based on [Matlab2018b](https://www.mathworks.com/) at least. 
The platform we are using is an improved development based on the existing platform. 
__`Not open to the public`__, therefore this code __`cannot`__ run on your computer, for reference only. üò≠
